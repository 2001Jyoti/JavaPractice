Write an algorithm to find the biggest of three numbers.
sol:
step1:start
step2:read the three numbers num1,num2,num3
step3:if(num1>num2)
             if(num1>num3)
                    print "num1 is bigger"
             else
                    print "num3 is bigger"
      else
             if(num2>num3)
                    print "num2 is bigger"
             else
                    print "num3 is bigger"
step4:stop
